# DecalPainter
Plugin For Source.Python

**This plugin is meant to paint a set of predefined decals/materials onto the active level without modifying the bsp.**
  
It's mainly handy to customize a map a bit to your own server/community without actually editing the map.  
There is an example included which paints some standard CSS decals @ CT spawn on de_dust2, but it fully supports and makes your own materials downloadable, which is it's intended use.
